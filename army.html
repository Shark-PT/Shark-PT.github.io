    Hello. Long story short. I was enlisted in 2002 as a soldier in the army as a communications soldier,and also as a  APC and truck driver.
    never got deployed overseas, since we are a peaceful nation, and aside some peacekeeping missions, we don't have that many combat missions, an APC and truck driver.
    <p>some examples of the hardware that i use </p>
