  <p>
  In Portugal there are 4 types of firefighters. There are volunters, wich are the largest part of the force, profissionals, privates and a combination of volunters and professionals. 
  wich city has one or more firefighters units.
  i enlisted two years ago and finish my training formation in June this year. 
  as a firefighter here we have to do several roles. EMT, rural fires, strutural fires, car acidents, etc. Since i have a driver license that allows me to drive trucks, i'm also a driver.
